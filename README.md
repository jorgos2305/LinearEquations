# LinearEquations

Inspiration for this program was taken from my old book "Linear Algebra" by Stanley I. Grossman S.
This is by no means perfect, but I really injoyed linear algebra while I was at the University so that my reason for it.

This programs helps solve 2x2 linear equations systems.

As explained during the first pages of the book, these equations systems have either a unique solution, no solution, or an infinate number fo solutions.
This can be explored through graphical representations:

1. For a unique solution the line intersect at only one point
2. For no solutions, lines are parallel and they don't ever intersect
3. Infinate solution, lines are equivalent
